1. separate the vectors and the outputs
2. discretize everything into 4 equal width buckets


have a dictionary
 -> class values
    -> each attribute
        -> 0 - 4 (for each bucket of the discretized attribute)
            :number of each observation in that bucket divided by number of attributes with that class label


setosa: {
    0: {
        0: 12/50,
        1: 12/50,
        2: 12/50,
        3: 14/50
    },
    1: {

    }, 
    2: {

    },
    3: {

    }
}

loop through every class value
    loop through each header
        loop through each instance
